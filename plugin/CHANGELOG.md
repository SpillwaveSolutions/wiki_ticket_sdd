# Changelog

## 0.3.0 — unreleased

- `worklog link`: attach external identities to work items via §5.3 link events.
- `worklog wiki-add`: register documents in the wiki publish set.
- ticket-sync skill: push-only sync to external trackers with ULID-marker
  idempotency; GitHub via `gh`, system-vague guidance elsewhere.
- /worklog:init system detection: confident yes/no path, multi-select
  pick-and-mix, upgrade skip.
- wiki-publish: default publish set + `source` field in the ledger.

## 0.2.0 — unreleased

- `worklog roadmap-snapshot` subcommand.
- `wiki-publish` skill: system-agnostic wiki publishing with a `published.json` ledger.
- Dogfood enforcement hooks: UserPromptSubmit reminder, Stop worklog check,
  SessionStart doctor-lite.
- Plugin installer/uninstaller scripts.
- User guide + README; docs live in the repo/wiki, deliberately NOT packaged
  in the plugin.

## 0.1.0 — unreleased

- Plugin scaffold: manifest, design captured as tracked work items
  (`docs/plans/2026-07-18-claude-plugin.md` in the source repo).
- `worklog --version`; version recorded in scaffolded repos and checked by `/worklog:doctor`.
